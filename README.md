# Term Homepage

A dead simple terminal-like personal homepage.

I was thinking about creating a separate home page for my research career and it should be something simple but cool. Originally, my thought was to build a real web-based interactive terminal (based on [Xterm.js](https://xtermjs.org/) or [JQueryTerminal](https://terminal.jcubic.pl/)), but it's a bit difficult for non-tech visitors and pure Javascript page needs additional efforts for SEO.

After several hours browsing [Terminal CSS](https://terminalcss.xyz/) and other terminal-like web pages, I finally decided to make it like this.
